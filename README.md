# Design Pattern
### [Wiki Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 

**Basically** Design Pattern makes your life easier when you plan to modify or add a new functionality to your already existing codebase.
I have made this project during my free time when i was reading the [Head First Design Pattern](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do).
